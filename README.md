Modeling Risk with Monte Carlo Simulation

Project Overview

This project demonstrates the use of **Monte Carlo Simulation** to model risk and uncertainty in various scenarios. Monte Carlo simulations rely on random sampling to model probabilistic processes and outcomes, providing deeper insights into the range of possible results and the associated risks. The project includes four key applications:

1. **Flipping a Coin** – Simulating a fair coin flip to explore basic probability and random processes.
2. **Stock Price Prediction** – Using historical data and random sampling to predict future stock prices.
3. **Value at Risk (VaR) Assessment** – Estimating potential financial losses in a given time frame using risk modeling techniques.
4. **Net Income Forecast & Capital Investment Forecast** – Applying Monte Carlo simulations to predict future net income and assess the financial risks associated with capital investments.

## Project Structure

### 1. **Flipping a Coin**
   - **Objective**: Model a simple probabilistic event of flipping a fair coin to explore the distribution of outcomes.
   - **Methodology**:
     - Run thousands of coin flip simulations.
     - Calculate the probability of heads vs. tails over many trials.
     - Assess the convergence of outcomes over larger datasets.
   - **Tools**: Python (NumPy, Matplotlib).

### 2. **Stock Price Prediction**
   - **Objective**: Simulate future stock prices using historical stock data and Monte Carlo simulations to model risk and volatility.
   - **Methodology**:
     - Use historical stock returns to model future price movements.
     - Apply random sampling based on historical volatility and mean returns to simulate thousands of potential future price paths.
     - Calculate average expected price, range, and the associated risk over different time horizons.
   - **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib).

### 3. **Value at Risk (VaR) Assessment**
   - **Objective**: Estimate the potential loss of a portfolio over a specified time horizon with a certain confidence level.
   - **Methodology**:
     - Use historical portfolio returns to model future risk.
     - Apply Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the probability distribution of future portfolio values.
     - Calculate Value at Risk (VaR) at different confidence intervals (e.g., 95%, 99%) to estimate maximum expected loss.
   - **Tools**: Python (Pandas, NumPy, SciPy).

### 4. **Net Income Forecast & Capital Investment Forecast**
   - **Objective**: Forecast a company's net income and capital investment outcomes while assessing associated financial risks.
   - **Methodology**:
     - Simulate various revenue, cost, and expense scenarios to predict net income.
     - Use random variables for key inputs such as market conditions, demand, and operating costs.
     - Forecast capital investment outcomes by considering uncertainties in project completion, costs, and returns.
     - Perform sensitivity analysis and scenario testing to evaluate risk.
   - **Tools**: Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy).

## Project Workflow

### 1. **Flipping a Coin**
   - Perform Monte Carlo simulations of thousands of coin flips.
   - Plot the frequency of heads/tails to observe the law of large numbers.

### 2. **Stock Price Prediction**
   - Historical stock data is loaded and analyzed.
   - Monte Carlo simulation generates thousands of possible price paths.
   - Outcomes are visualized and interpreted based on projected price ranges and risks.

### 3. **Value at Risk (VaR) Assessment**
   - Portfolio data is analyzed to simulate future returns.
   - VaR is computed based on a simulated distribution of potential outcomes.
   - The final results provide potential loss ranges under different confidence intervals.

### 4. **Net Income and Capital Investment Forecast**
   - Input data is fed into the simulation to generate future income forecasts.
   - The sensitivity of net income to different revenue and expense variables is examined.
   - Capital investment forecasts are modeled, and risk factors are highlighted.

## Key Concepts

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: A statistical technique that models the probability of different outcomes by running multiple simulations with random variables.
- **Random Sampling**: The process of generating random values to simulate different scenarios in uncertain environments.
- **Value at Risk (VaR)**: A risk measure used to estimate the potential loss of an investment portfolio within a given confidence interval and time period.

## Results

- **Coin Flip Simulation**: Demonstrates the principles of probability and randomness with a simple example.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Provides insight into how stock prices could fluctuate in the future and helps quantify the potential risk of investments.
- **VaR Assessment**: Offers a clear understanding of the risk exposure of a financial portfolio.
- **Income and Investment Forecast**: Helps businesses understand potential financial outcomes and plan accordingly by considering different variables.

## Future Improvements

- Extend the forecasting model to cover additional business financial metrics.
